Abstract: 

Books are a great source of inspirations to people. Readers
are searching for better books and organizations like online
book stores, government organizations are curious in under-
standing users interest and opinions. Book reviews in the
form of text and rating are a good source of informative data
that can be used for research. Our work in this research is
deeply focused in understanding book reviews through text
reviews and star ratings given to the book by readers. We
explore growth and decline, sentiments, relation between
review-rating and prediction of ratings from review for two
specific genres i.e. Comics & Graphics and Mystery, Thriller
& Crime. Our research contributes in understanding the
dynamics of book reviews that can be useful for academic in-
stitutions, writers, readers, online book stores, governments
organizations.
